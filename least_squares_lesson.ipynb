    "# Introduction to Least Squares Fitting with Flight Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the **least squares method** by applying it to a dataset containing information about flight prices and durations. Least squares is a fundamental technique in regression analysis that helps us find the best-fitting line through a set of data points by minimising the sum of the squared differences between observed values and the values predicted by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "We aim to model the relationship between flight prices and durations. By applying the least squares method, we can estimate how flight duration affects prices and predict future prices based on the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset contains the following key features:\n",
    "- **Flight Price**: The cost of a flight ticket in GBP.\n",
    "- **Flight Duration**: The total time of the flight in hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand how the least squares method works.\n",
    "- Visualise the relationship between flight prices and durations.\n",
    "- Implement a simple linear regression model using the least squares approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s begin by loading the data and exploring the relationship between these variables."

    "### Finding the Line of Best Fit\n",

    "- **c** is the y-intercept, which is the price when the flight duration is zero, i.e. the fixed costs per passenger.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to approach this is to visually estimate the line by eye, trying to guess both the slope (m) and the intercept (c).\n",
